            <h3>HELLO</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
Hello, with that spelling, was used in publications in the US as early as the 18 October 1826 edition of the Norwich Courier of Norwich, Connecticut.[1] Another early use was an 1833 American book called The Sketches and Eccentricities of Col. David Crockett, of West Tennessee,[2] which was reprinted that same year in The London Literary Gazette.[3] The word was extensively used in literature by the 1860s          </p>

          <h3>NAMASKAR</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
Namaskar is most popularly used as a humbling greeting in Indian, Nepali, Bangladeshi, and other Southeast Asian cultures. Perhaps more familiar to Westerners is its use in some yoga traditions. Surya namaskar, or “sun salutation,” is one of the most common sequences in yoga practice. Many hatha and vinyasa yoga classes begin with a surya namaskar sequence. While namaskar’s close cousin, namaste, is often used as a greeting or closing in Western yoga practice, the term itself has little to no role in Indian yoga historically</p>      </div>
